# Detect Cycle in UnDirected Graph using BFS/DFS Algo

Difficulty Level : Medium

Given an undirected graph with V vertices labelled from 0 to V-1 and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not. Graph is in the form of adjacency list where adj[i] contains all the nodes ith node is having edge with.

NOTE: The adjacency list denotes the edges of the graph where edges[i] stores all other vertices to which ith vertex is connected.

**Examples :**

```
Input: V = 5, E = 5
adj = [[1], [0, 2, 4], [1, 3], [2, 4], [1, 3]] 
Output: 1
Explanation: 
1->2->3->4->1 is a cycle.
```
