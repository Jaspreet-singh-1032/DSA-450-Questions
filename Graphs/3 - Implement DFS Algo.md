# Implement DFS algorithm

Difficulty Level : Easy

You are given a connected undirected graph. Perform a Depth First Traversal of the graph.
Note: Use the recursive approach to find the DFS traversal of the graph starting from the 0th vertex from left to right according to the graph.

**Examples :**

```
Input: V = 5 , adj = [[2,3,1] , [0], [0,4], [0], [2]]
Output: 0 2 4 3 1
Explanation: 
0 is connected to 2, 3, 1.
1 is connected to 0.
2 is connected to 0 and 4.
3 is connected to 0.
4 is connected to 2.
so starting from 0, it will go to 2 then 4,
and then 3 and 1.
Thus dfs will be 0 2 4 3 1.
