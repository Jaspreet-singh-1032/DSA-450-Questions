# Implement "N" stacks in an Array

Difficulty Level : Hard

Design a data structure to implement ‘N’ stacks using a single array of size ‘S’. It should support the following operations:

push(X, M): Pushes an element X into the Mth stack. Returns true if the element is pushed into the stack, otherwise false.

pop(M): Pops the top element from Mth Stack. Returns -1 if the stack is empty, otherwise, returns the popped element.
Two types of queries denote these operations :

Type 1: for push(X, M) operation.
Type 2: for pop(M) operation.

**Examples :**

```
Input:
3 6 5
1 10 1
1 20 1
1 30 2
2 1
2 2
Output:
True 
True
True
20
30
Explanation:
For the given input, we have the number of stacks, N = 3, size of the array, S = 6 and number of queries, Q = 5.
Operations performed on the stack are as follows:
push(10, 1): Push element ‘10’ into the 1st stack. This returns true.
push(20, 1): Push element ‘20’ into the 1st stack. This returns true.
push(30, 2): Push element ‘30’ into the 2nd stack. This returns true.
pop(1): Pop the top element from the 1st stack. This returns 20.
pop(2): Pop the top element from the 2nd stack. This returns 30.
