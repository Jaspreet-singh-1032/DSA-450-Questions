# Design a Stack that supports getMin() in O(1) time and O(1) extra space

Difficulty Level : Easy

Design a data-structure SpecialStack that supports all the stack operations like push(), pop(), isEmpty(), isFull() and an additional operation getMin() which should return the minimum element from the SpecialStack. Your task is to complete all the functions, using a stack data structure.

Note: The output of the code will be the value returned by getMin() function.

**Examples :**

```
Input: stack: 18 19 29 15 16
Output: 15
Explanation: The minimum element of the stack is 15.
```
