# Searching in an array where adjacent differ by at most k

Difficulty Level : Easy

Given a step array arr[], its step value k, and a key x, we need to find the index of key x in the array arr[]. If multiple occurrences of key x exist, return the first occurrence of the key. In case of no occurrence of key x exists return -1.

Note: A step array is an array of integers where the difference between adjacent elements is at most k. For example: arr[] = [4, 6, 7, 9] and k = 2 is a step array as the difference between the adjacent elements in the arr[] is at most 2.  

**Examples :**

```
Input: arr[] = [4, 5, 6, 7, 6] , k = 1 , x = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: In an array arr 6 is present at index 2. So, return 2.
```
