# Find a Fixed Point (Value equal to index) in a given array

Difficulty Level : Easy

Given an array arr. Your task is to find the elements whose value is equal to that of its index value ( Consider 1-based indexing ).

Note: There can be more than one element in the array which have the same value as its index. You need to include every such element's index. Follows 1-based indexing of the array.

**Examples :**

```
Input: arr[] = [15, 2, 45, 4 , 7]
Output: 2 , 4
Explanation:
