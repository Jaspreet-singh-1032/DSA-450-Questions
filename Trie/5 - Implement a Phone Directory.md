# Implement a Phone Directory

Difficulty Level : Hard

Given a list of contacts contact[] of length n where each contact is a string which exist in a phone directory and a query string s. The task is to implement a search query for the phone directory. Run a search query for each prefix p of the query string s (i.e. from  index 1 to |s|) that prints all the distinct contacts which have the same prefix as p in lexicographical increasing order. Please refer the explanation part for better understanding.
Note: If there is no match between query and contacts, print "0".

**Examples :**

```
Input: 
n = 3
contact[] = {"geeikistest", "geeksforgeeks", 
"geeksfortest"}
s = "geeips"
Output:
geeikistest geeksforgeeks geeksfortest
geeikistest geeksforgeeks geeksfortest
geeikistest geeksforgeeks geeksfortest
geeikistest
0
0
Explaination: By running the search query on 
contact list for "g" we get: "geeikistest", 
"geeksforgeeks" and "geeksfortest".
By running the search query on contact list 
for "ge" we get: "geeikistest" "geeksforgeeks"
and "geeksfortest".
By running the search query on contact list 
for "gee" we get: "geeikistest" "geeksforgeeks"
and "geeksfortest".
By running the search query on contact list 
for "geei" we get: "geeikistest".
No results found for "geeip", so print "0". 
No results found for "geeips", so print "0".
```
