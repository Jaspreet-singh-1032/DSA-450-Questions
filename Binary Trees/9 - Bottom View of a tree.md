# Bottom View of a tree

Difficulty Level : Medium

Given a binary tree, return an array where elements represent the bottom view of the binary tree from left to right.

Note: If there are multiple bottom-most nodes for a horizontal distance from the root, then the latter one in the level traversal is considered. For example, in the below diagram, 3 and 4 are both the bottommost nodes at a horizontal distance of 0, here 4 will be considered.

                      20
                    /    \
                  8       22
                /   \     /   \
              5      3 4     25
                     /    \      
                 10       14

For the above tree, the output should be 5 10 4 14 25.

**Examples :**

```
Input:
       1
     /   \
    3     2
Output: 3 1 2
Explanation: First case represents a tree with 3 nodes and 2 edges where root is 1, left child of 1 is 3 and right child of 1 is 2.
Thus bottom view of the binary tree will be 3 1 2.
