# Left View of a tree

Difficulty Level : Easy

Given a Binary Tree, return its Left view. The left view of a Binary Tree is a set of nodes visible when the tree is visited from the Left side. If no left view is possible, return an empty array.

**Examples :**

```
Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, N, 8]
          1
       /     \
     2        3
   /     \    /    \
  4     5   6    7
   \
     8   
Output: [1, 2, 4, 8]
Explanation: When we view the tree from the left side, we can only see the nodes 1, 2, 4, and 8.
