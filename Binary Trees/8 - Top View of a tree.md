# Top View of a tree

Difficulty Level : Medium

Given below is a binary tree. The task is to print the top view of binary tree. Top view of a binary tree is the set of nodes visible when the tree is viewed from the top. For the given below tree

       1
    /     \
   2       3
  /  \    /   \
4    5  6   7

Top view will be: 4 2 1 3 7
Note: Return nodes from leftmost node to rightmost node. Also if 2 nodes are outside the shadow of the tree and are at same position then consider the left ones only(i.e. leftmost). 
For ex - 1 2 3 N 4 5 N 6 N 7 N 8 N 9 N N N N N will give 8 2 1 3 as answer. Here 8 and 9 are on the same position but 9 will get shadowed.

**Examples :**

```

      1
   /    \
  2      3
Output: 2 1 3
