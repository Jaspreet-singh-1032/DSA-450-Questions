# Implement a Maxheap/MinHeap using arrays and recursion.

Difficulty Level : Easy

Given a Binary Heap of size N in an array arr[]. Write a program to calculate the height of the Heap.

Note: Return 1 if the N is 1.

**Examples :**

```
Input: N = 6
arr = {1, 3, 6, 5, 9, 8}
Output: 2
Explaination: The tree is like the following
        (1)
       /   \
    (3)    (6)
    / \     /
  (5) (9) (8)
```
