# Smallest range in “K” Lists

Difficulty Level : Hard

Given K sorted lists of integers, KSortedArray[] of size N each. The task is to find the smallest range that includes at least one element from each of the K lists. If more than one such range's are found, return the first such range found.

**Examples :**

```
Input:
N = 5, K = 3
KSortedArray[][] = {{1 3 5 7 9},
                    {0 2 4 6 8},
                    {2 3 5 7 11}}
Output: 1 2
Explanation: K = 3
A:[1 3 5 7 9]
B:[0 2 4 6 8]
C:[2 3 5 7 11]
Smallest range is formed by number 1
present in first list and 2 is present
in both 2nd and 3rd list.
