# Maximum of all subarrays of size k

Difficulty Level : Medium

You are given an array consisting of N non-negative integers, and an integer K denoting the length of a subarray, your task is to determine the maximum elements for each subarray of size K.

Note:
A subarray is a contiguous subset of an array.

The array may contain duplicate elements.

The given array follows 0-based indexing.

It is guaranteed that there exists at least one subarray of size K.

**Examples :**

```
Input:
1
4 2
10 7 8 11
Output:
10 8 11
Explanation:
The first subarray of length 2 is [10,7] and the maximum of it is 10, then the next subarray of length 2 is [7,8] and the maximum of it is 8, and the last subarray of size 2 is [8,11] and the maximum of it is 11, So the output is [10,8,11].
