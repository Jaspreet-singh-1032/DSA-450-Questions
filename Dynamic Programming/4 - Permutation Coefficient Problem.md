# Permutation Coefficient Problem

Difficulty Level : Medium

Given two integers n and k, The task is to calculate Permutation Coefficient P(n,k).
Note:  P(n, k) is used to represent the number of ways to obtain an ordered subset having k elements from a set of n elements. Since this value may be large only find it modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Examples :**

```
Input: n = 10, k = 2
Output: 90
Explanation: For first case: Ans = 10! / (10 - 2)! = 10! / 8! , 10! is 8!*9*10 and 8! is 8!, Ans = 9*10 = 90.
```
