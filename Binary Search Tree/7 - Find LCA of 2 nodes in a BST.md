# Find LCA of 2 nodes in a BST

Difficulty Level : Easy

Given a Binary Search Tree (with all values unique) and two node values n1 and n2 (n1!=n2). Find the Lowest Common Ancestors of the two nodes in the BST.

**Examples :**

```
Input:
              5
            /   \
          4      6

                    \

n1 = 7, n2 = 8
Output: 7
