# Check if a tree is a BST or not

Difficulty Level : Easy

Given the root of a binary tree. Check whether it is a BST or not.
Note: We are considering that BSTs can not contain duplicate Nodes.
A BST is defined as follows:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Examples :**

```
Input:
   2
 /    \
1      3
        \
         5
Output: true 
Explanation: 
The left subtree of every node contains smaller keys and right subtree of every node contains greater. Hence, the tree is a BST.
