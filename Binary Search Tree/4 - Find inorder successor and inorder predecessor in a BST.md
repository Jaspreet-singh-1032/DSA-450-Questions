# Find inorder successor and inorder predecessor in a BST

Difficulty Level : Medium

There is BST given with the root node with the key part as an integer only. You need to find the in-order successor and predecessor of a given key. If either predecessor or successor is not found, then set it to NULL.

Note:- In an inorder traversal the number just smaller than the target is the predecessor and the number just greater than the target is the successor. 

**Examples :**

```
Input:
      8
    /   \
   1     9
    \     \
     4    10
    /
   3
key = 8 
Output: 4 9
Explanation: 
In the given BST the inorder predecessor of 8 is 4 and inorder successor of 8 is 9.
