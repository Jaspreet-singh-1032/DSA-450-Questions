# Find the minimum and maximum amount to buy all N candies

Difficulty Level : Easy

In a candy store, there are n different types of candies available and the prices of all the N different types of candies are provided to you. You are now provided with an attractive offer.
For every candy you buy from the store and get K other candies ( all are different types ) for free. Now you have to answer two questions. Firstly, you have to find what is the minimum amount of money you have to spend to buy all the n different candies. Secondly, you have to find what is the maximum amount of money you have to spend to buy all the n different candies.
In both the cases you must utilize the offer i.e. you buy one candy and get k other candies for free.

**Examples :**

```
Input: n = 4, k = 2, candies[] = {3 2 1 4}
Output: 3 7
Explanation: As according to the offer if you buy one candy you can take at most two  more for free. So in the first case, you buy the candy which costs 1 and takes candies worth 3 and 4 for free, also you buy candy worth 2 as well.So min cost : 1+2 =3. In the second case, you can buy the candy which costs 4 and takes candies worth 1 and 2 for free, also you need to buy candy worth 3 as well. So max cost : 3+4 =7.
