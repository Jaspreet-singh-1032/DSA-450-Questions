# Print all Subsequences of a string

Difficulty Level : Medium

Given a string S, the task is to count number of subsequences of the form aibjck, where i >= 1, j >=1 and k >= 1.

Note: 
1. Two subsequences are considered different if the set of array indexes picked for the 2 subsequences are different.
2.  For large test cases, the output value will be too large, return the answer MODULO 10^9+7

**Examples :**

```
Input:
S = "abbc"
Output: 3
Explanation: Subsequences are abc, abc and abbc.
```
