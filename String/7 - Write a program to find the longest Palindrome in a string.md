# program to find the longest Palindrome in a string

Difficulty Level : Medium

Given a string str, find the longest palindromic substring in str. Substring of string str: str[ i . . . . j ] where 0 ≤ i ≤ j < len(str). Return the longest palindromic substring of str.

Palindrome string: A string that reads the same backward. More formally, str is a palindrome if reverse(str) = str. In case of conflict, return the substring which occurs first ( with the least starting index).

**Examples :**

```
Input: str = "aaaabbaa"
Output: aabbaa
Explanation: The longest Palindromic substring is "aabbaa".
```
