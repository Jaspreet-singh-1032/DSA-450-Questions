# Common elements in all rows of a given matrix

Difficulty Level : Medium

You are given a 2-D Matrix 'MAT' having 'N' rows and 'M' columns, respectively. Your task is to find all elements which are present in each row of the matrix.

Note :
1. The output array can contain the elements in any particular order.

2. Even if a particular element appears more than once in each matrix row, it should still be present only once in the output array.
For Example :
Consider the matrix MAT [ [ 2, 3, 4, 7 ] , [ 0, 0, 3, 5 ] , [ 1, 3, 8, 9 ] ] having 3 rows and 4 columns respectively.
The output array should be [ 3 ] as 3 is the only element that is present in all three rows.

**Examples :**

```
Input:
2
3 4
1 4 5 6
3 4 5 6
5 6 7 2
3 2
4 6 
6 4
2 6
Output:
5 6
6
```
