# Maximum size rectangle

Difficulty Level : Hard

Given a binary matrix M of size n X m. Find the maximum area of a rectangle formed only of 1s in the given matrix.

**Examples :**

```
Input:
n = 4, m = 4
M[][] = {{0 1 1 0},
         {1 1 1 1},
         {1 1 1 1},
         {1 1 0 0}}
Output: 8
Explanation: For the above test case the
matrix will look like
0 1 1 0
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0
the max size rectangle is 
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
and area is 4 *2 = 8.
