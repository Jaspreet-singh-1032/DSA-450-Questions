# Rotate matrix by 90 degrees

Difficulty Level : Medium

You are given a square matrix of non-negative integers of size 'N x N'. Your task is to rotate that array by 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space.

For example:

For given 2D array :

    [    [ 1,  2,  3 ],
         [ 4,  5,  6 ],
         [ 7,  8,  9 ]  ]

After 90 degree rotation in anti clockwise direction, it will become:

    [   [ 3,  6,  9 ],
        [ 2,  5,  8 ],
        [ 1,  4,  7 ]   ]

**Examples :**

```
Input:
2
3
1  2  3
4  5  6
7  8  9
4
1  2  3  4 
5  6  7  8 
9 10 11 12 
13 14 15 16
Output:
3  6  9 
2  5  8 
1  4  7
4  8 12 16 
3  7 11 15 
2  6 10 14 
1  5  9 13
