# Write a program to Add two numbers represented by linked lists.	

Difficulty Level : Medium

Given two numbers, num1, and num2, represented by linked lists. The task is to return the head of the linked list representing the sum of these two numbers.

For example, the number 190 will be represented by the linked list, 1->9->0->null, similarly 25 by 2->5->null. Sum of these two numbers is 190 + 25 = 215, which will be represented by 2->1->5->null. You are required to return the head of the linked list 2->1->5->null.

Note: There can be leading zeros in the input lists, but there should not be any leading zeros in the output list.

**Examples :**

```
Input: num1 = 45 (4->5->null), num2 = 345 (3->4->5->null)
Output:  3->9->0->null  
Explanation: 
For the given two linked list (4 5) and (3 4 5), after adding the two linked list resultant linked list will be (3 9 0).
```
