# Write a program to Remove Duplicates from an Unsorted Linked List	

Difficulty Level : Easy

Given an unsorted linked list. The task is to remove duplicate elements from this unsorted Linked List. When a value appears in multiple nodes, the node which appeared first should be kept, all other duplicates are to be removed.

**Examples :**

```
Input: LinkedList: 5->2->2->4
Output: 5->2->4
Explanation: Given linked list elements are 5->2->2->4, in which 2 is repeated only. So, we will delete the extra repeated elements 2 from the linked list and the resultant linked list will contain 5->2->4
```
