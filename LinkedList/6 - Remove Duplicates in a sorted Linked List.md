# Write a program to Remove Duplicates in a sorted Linked List.		

Difficulty Level : Easy

Given a singly linked list. The task is to remove duplicates (nodes with duplicate values) from the given list (if it exists).
Note: Try not to use extra space. The nodes are arranged in a sorted way.

**Examples :**

```
Input:
LinkedList: 2->2->4->5
Output: 2 -> 4 -> 5
Explanation: In the given linked list 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5, only 2 occurs more than 1 time. So we need to remove it once.
```
