# Divide two integers without using multiplication, division and mod operator

Difficulty Level : Medium

Given two integers dividend and divisor. Find the quotient after dividing the dividend by divisor without using multiplication, division and mod operator.

Note: If the quotient is strictly greater than 2^31 - 1, return 2^31 - 1 and if the quotient is strictly less than -2^31, then return -2^31.

**Examples :**

```
Input: dividend = 10, divisor= 3
Output: 3
Exaplanation: 10/3 gives quotient as 3 and remainder as 1.
```
