# Count number of bits to be flipped to convert A to B

Difficulty Level : Easy

You are given two numbers A and B. The task is to count the number of bits needed to be flipped to convert A to B.

**Examples :**

```
Input: A = 10, B = 20
Output: 4
Explanation:
A  = 01010
B  = 10100
As we can see, the bits of A that need 
to be flipped are 01010. If we flip 
these bits, we get 10100, which is B
