# Sudoku Solver

Difficulty Level : Hard

Given an incomplete Sudoku configuration in terms of a 9 x 9  2-D square matrix (grid[][]), the task is to find a solved Sudoku. For simplicity, you may assume that there will be only one unique solution.

A sudoku solution must satisfy all of the following rules:

Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each row.
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each column.
Each of the digits 1-9 must occur exactly once in each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid.
Zeros in the grid indicates blanks, which are to be filled with some number between 1-9. You can not replace the element in the cell which is not blank.

**Examples :**

```
Input:
grid[][] = 
[[3 0 6 5 0 8 4 0 0],
[5 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0],
[0 8 7 0 0 0 0 3 1 ],
[0 0 3 0 1 0 0 8 0],
[9 0 0 8 6 3 0 0 5],
[0 5 0 0 9 0 6 0 0],
[1 3 0 0 0 0 2 5 0],
[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 4],
[0 0 5 2 0 6 3 0 0]]
Output:
