# Tug of War

Difficulty Level : Easy

You are a coach of a group consisting of 'N' students. The ith student has a strength Arr[i]. For a Tug of War game, you want to divide students into two teams of equal size (If N is odd, then size of one team should be (N-1)/2 and size of other team should be (N+1)/2). You want a game that is fun, for this the absolute difference between the team’s strength should be as minimum as possible. A team's strength is the sum of the strengths of the students in the team.

Explanation for Sample Input 1:
In the 1st test case, the first team contains students with strength {1, 4} and the second team contains students with strength {2, 3}, the absolute difference between the team’s strength is (1+5)-(2+3)=0.

In the 2nd test case, the first team contains students with strength {1, 2} and the second team contains students with strength {4}, the absolute difference between the team’s strength is (4)-(1+2)=1.

In the 3rd test case, the first team contains students with strength {6} and the second team contains students with strength {8}, the absolute difference between the team’s strength is (8)-(6)=2.
