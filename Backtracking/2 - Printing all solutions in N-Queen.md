# Printing all solutions in N-Queen

Difficulty Level : Hard

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on a (n√ón) chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other.
Given an integer n, find all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. Each solution contains distinct board configurations of the n-queens placement, where the solutions are a permutation of [1,2,3..n] in increasing order, here the number in the ith place denotes that the ith-column queen is placed in the row with that number. For eg below figure represents a chessboard [3 1 4 2].
